<h1>Production Counter</h1>

Used to count and track pieces of finished material on a production line using Python, Gspread, Tkinter, an IR sensor, and a Raspberry pi.

Interface is built with Tkinters GUI builder and displays the current number of manufactures parts that has moved past the IR "eye". Operators are able to adjust the count manually using the +/- button on the screen. The count is also uploaded to a google spreadsheet of your choice every night at 12am.
